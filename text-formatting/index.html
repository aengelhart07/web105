    <h2>By House House</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Untitled Goose Game</b> is a simple game about a goose being a nuisance while
        completing goals. <br> How much of a silly goose can you be? </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><q>It's a <i>lovely</i> morning in the village, and you are a <i>horrible</i>
            goose.</q><br>The pure quote by creators efficiently set the mood of the game style.
    <p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <!--basic plot-->
    <p>In September of 2019, developed by House House and published by Panic, Untitled Goose Game was released. The art
        style
        is minimalistic. The soundtrack is melodic piano filled. This is a puzzle-based game that relies on stealth. All
        together making the game gentle and relaxing. It became a major hit, winning awards and being nominated for many
        more.</p>
    <p>In a decent sized English village, the player runs around as a chaotic goose. The goose can run, duck, flap
        wings,
        interact with objects using beak, and of course, honk. Each section of town has its own challenges and features.
        There
        are plenty of characters and objects to interact with.</p>
    <p>Some of the fun is startling the people, some is theft. Tasks include annoying a poor gardener, agitating
        neighbors, and disturbing a pub. It is all about the chase.</p>

    <h3>Opinion</h3>
    <h4>Untitled Goose Game is simplistic yet entertaining.</h4>
    <p>It is simply fun. It makes being the bad guy enjoyable. The tasks are silly, and the end game is a speed
        challenge. It
        leaves room for adventure and new ways to bother the neighborhood. Overall, the game is a great and relaxing.
    </p>
    <p>The only downside is the short playthrough, but finishing a game does not mean that playing it stops.</p>

    <h3 style="color: khaki;">Update</h3>

    <p>One year after the release, coming in a month, there will be an addition to the game. Co-op will be coming to
        Untitled
        Goose Game. A new Chinese goose will be added with red bill and legs. This will allow two players to team up and
